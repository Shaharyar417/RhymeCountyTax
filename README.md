/---------------------------------------------------------------------------[ Description ]---

The code that I provided in this repositoriy is of 5 sorting algorithms that I explained
above. this is a project that I did from coursera. I have provided the link so that if you
want to do it yourself from coursera and earn a certificate you can do it. I did this project
by using Rhyme software that coursera provide as a platform for the project. In it you can work
by side with your instructor.

/==============[ What this project do? ]
In this project, we sort the tax data of a city named as Missari. And tax data is big.
We evaluate these tax data on different sorting algorithm and define the time complexity
and also the space complecity of that sorting algorithms. And compare them with each other
and fine the efficient soritng algorithm.

/===========[ Setup ]
You can download this project from my repositry and for running it and evaluating
yourself, you can import this projct in any of the IDE of java. Like eclipse or netbeans.
And by calling one sorting algorithm at one point and other separately you will see the 
difference between them.

Morover I have provided the link of the video explanation of this project.
If you can not understand yourself go and check my video on this.
